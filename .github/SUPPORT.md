# Support

Thanks for using Tungsten! This document explains how to get help or report problems.

## Getting Help
- **Documentation**: Start with the docs in `docs/`, especially the Introduction and Reference sections.
- **Issues**: Open a GitHub issue for bugs, feature requests, syntax requests or questions.

## Reporting Bugs
Please include:
- A concise summary of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your OS, Neovim version, and Tungsten version/commit
- Any relevant logs or error output

## Feature Requests
Describe the use case, why it matters, and any constraints (e.g., backend limitations).

## Syntax Requests
Describe the requested syntax thoroughly and give verbatim LaTeX-formatted examples.

## Security Issues
If you believe you have found a security issue, please avoid public disclosure. Use GitHub Security Advisories if available, or contact the maintainer directly through GitHub.
